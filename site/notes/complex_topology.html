<p>Practice problems:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>True or False: Union of two open sets is open.</li>
<li>True or False: Intersection of two open sets is open.</li>
<li>True or False: Union of two closed sets is closed.</li>
<li>True or False: Intersection of two closed sets is closed.</li>
<li>What about questions 1-4 but for infinitely many sets rather than just 2?</li>
<li>An “open rectangle” <span class="math">\((a,b)\times (c,d)\)</span> is defined as all complex numbers whose real part is between <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> and whose imaginary part is between <span class="math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d\)</span>. Show that the open rectangle is in fact an open set.</li>
<li>Show that the “closed rectangle” is in fact a closed set.</li>
<li>True or False: A set can be both open and closed at the same time.</li>
<li>Suppose <span class="math">\(U\)</span> is an open set, <span class="math">\(z_n\)</span> a sequence, <span class="math">\(z_n\to z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z\in U\)</span>. Show that there is an <span class="math">\(N\)</span> such that for all <span class="math">\(n\geq N\)</span> we have <span class="math">\(z_n\in U\)</span>.</li>
<li>Show that an open set does not contain any of its boundary points.</li>
<li>Show that a closed set contains all of its boundary points.</li>
<li>Show that a single point is a closed set.</li>
<li>Suppose <span class="math">\(f\colon\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\)</span> is continuous, and <span class="math">\(U\subset\mathbb{C}\)</span> is set. Recall the definition of the set <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(U) = \left\{ x\mid f(x)\in U\right\}\)</span>, which makes sense regardless of whether <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is an invertible function. Show that if <span class="math">\(U\)</span> is an open set then <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(U)\)</span> is an open set. (Use <span class="math">\(\epsilon-\delta\)</span> definition of continuity)</li>
<li>Show that if <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is continuous and <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is a closed set then <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(K)\)</span> is closed.</li>
<li>Find a continuous function <span class="math">\(f\colon\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\)</span> and a set <span class="math">\(U\)</span> that is open but such that <span class="math">\(f(U)\)</span> is not open.</li>
<li>Find a continuous function <span class="math">\(f\colon\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}\)</span> and a set <span class="math">\(K\)</span> that is closed but such that <span class="math">\(f(K)\)</span> is not closed. (It will have to be an unbounded set)</li>
<li>Show that if <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is a compact set and <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is a closed set, then <span class="math">\(K\cap F\)</span> is compact.</li>
<li>Show that if <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is continuous and <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is a compact set then <span class="math">\(f(K)\)</span> is a compact set. (use definition via sequences)</li>

<li>Notion of open set.
<ul>
<li>For each of its points, the set contains an open disc centered at each that point.</li>

<li>What is the largest open set? The smallest?</li>
<li>What are the open sets in the real line?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Notion of a closed set.
<ul>
<li>Closed sets are the complements of open sets.</li>
<li>What is the smallest/largest closed set?</li>
<li>The closed disc is a closed set.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A set is closed iff the limit of every convergent sequence from the set is also in the set.
<ul>
<li>The closed disc is a closed set, proof by thinking of the characterization via sequences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Closed and bounded sets are called compact.
