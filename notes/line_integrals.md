## Topics to know

1. Notions of piecewise-differentiable curves and of smooth curves (4.2)
2. Integral of a complex-valued function of a real variable (4.1).
3. Integrate $1/z$ and $1/z^2$ over a circle around $0$. (page 48)
4. Integral of $f(z)$ along a smooth curve.
5. Integrals of $f(z)$ over equivalent curves are equal.
6. Integral over the opposite curve is the negative of the integral over the curve.
7. Linearity of the integral (proposition 4.8).
8. $\displaystyle\int_a^b G(t)dt \ll \int_a^b |G(t)|dt$.
9. ML-formula: If $f\ll M$ along a curve $C$ of length $L$, then:
    $$\int_C f(z)dz = \int_a^b f(z(t))\dot z(t)\ll \int_a^b|f(z(t))\dot z(t)|dt\ll M\int_a^b|\dot z(t)|dt = ML$$
10. If $f_n\to f$ uniformly on $C$, then $\int_C f_n(z)dz\to \int_C f(z)dz$.
11. If $F'(z) = f(z)$ then $\int_C f(z)dz = F(z(b)) - F(z(a))$.
