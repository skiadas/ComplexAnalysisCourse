## Problems

Practice problems:

1. True or False: Union of two open sets is open.
2. True or False: Intersection of two open sets is open.
3. True or False: Union of two closed sets is closed.
4. True or False: Intersection of two closed sets is closed.
5. What about questions 1-4 but for infinitely many sets rather than just 2?
6. An "open rectangle" $(a,b)\times (c,d)$ is defined as all complex numbers whose real part is between $a$ and $b$ and whose imaginary part is between $c$ and $d$. Show that the open rectangle is in fact an open set.
7. Show that the "closed rectangle" is in fact a closed set.
8. True or False: A set can be both open and closed at the same time.
9. Suppose $f\colon\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ is continuous, and $U\subset\mathbb{C}$ is set. Recall the definition of the set $f^{-1}(U) = \left\{ x\mid f(x)\in U\right\}$, which makes sense regardless of whether $f$ is an invertible function. Show that if $U$ is an open set then $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open set. (Use $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of continuity)
10. Show that if $f$ is continuous and $K$ is a closed set then $f^{-1}(K)$ is closed.
11. Find a continuous function $f\colon\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ and a set $U$ that is open but such that $f(U)$ is not open.
12. Find a continuous function $f\colon\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ and a set $K$ that is closed but such that $f(K)$ is not closed. (It will have to be an unbounded set)
13. Show that if $f$ is continuous and $K$ is a compact set then $f(K)$ is a compact set. (use definition via sequences)

## Topics to know

1. Open disc of radius $r$ around a point. Picture.
    - Also "closed disc".
2. Notion of open set.
    - For each of its points, the set contains an open disc centered at each that point.
    - The open disc itself is an open set. This is not obvious.
    - What is the largest open set? The smallest?
    - What are the open sets in the real line?
3. Notion of a closed set.
    - Closed sets are the complements of open sets.
    - What is the smallest/largest closed set?
    - The closed disc is a closed set.
4. A set is closed iff the limit of every convergent sequence from the set is also in the set.
    - The closed disc is a closed set, proof by thinking of the characterization via sequences.
5. Closed and bounded sets are called compact.
    - Set is compact if and only if every sequence from the set has a subsequence converging within the set.
6. Polygonally-connected sets.
    - Open and polygonally-connected sets are called regions.
7. Continuous functions.
    - Definition via $\epsilon-\delta$.
    - Definition via sequences.
