## Topics to know

1. Definition of "analytic polynomial"
2. A polynomial is analytic iff $P_y = iP_x$
    - One direction: Straightforward (basically boils down to $z^k$ case)
    - Other direction: Focus on "same degree"
3. Rewrite equations in terms of $u,v$ components
4. Definition of differentiable functions
