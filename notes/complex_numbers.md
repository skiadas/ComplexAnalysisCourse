- Practice Problems (page 18): 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12
- Problems to be ready to present: 8
- Challenge: 13, 14
- More practice problems:
    1. Recall the definitions of $\bar z$ and $z^{-1}$. Show that $\bar z = z^{-1}$ if and only if $z$ lies on the unit circle (all complex numbers with length $1$).
    2. Show that if $z$ is an $n$-th root of $1$, then $z$ must lie on the unit circle.
    3. Suppose $z$ is an $n$-th root of $1$. Show that $z^{-1} = z^{n-1}$.
    4. Suppose $z\neq 1$ is a third root of $1$.
        - Use the result of problem 13 to show that $1 + z + \bar z = 0$.
        - Use this equation, and the fact that $z$ has length $1$, to show that $z = \frac{-1\pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
    5. Suppose $z\neq 1$ is a fifth root of $1$.
        - Show that $z = 1 + z + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{1}{z} = 0$.
        - Use this to show that if we set $w = z + \frac{1}{z}$ then we have $w + w^2 = 1$.
        - From that last equation find $w$, and then from the previous equation find $z$. You should be finding 4 different solutions this way.
        - Examine the four numbers on the plane, and with that information in hand find $\cos\frac{2\pi}{5}$ and $\sin\frac{2\pi}{5}$. Use Wolfram Alpha [http://www.wolframalpha.com/](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) to verify the formula you found.
    6. Consider the vectors based at the origin and ending at the complex numbers $z$ and $w$ respectively. Show that the dot product between the two vectors equals the real part of $z\bar w$.
    7. True or false: The vectors based at the origin and ending at the complex numbers $z$ and $w$ respectively are perpendicular if and only if $z/w$ is a purely imaginary number.
