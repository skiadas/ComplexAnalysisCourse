<li>Also “closed disc”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Notion of open set.</li>
<li>The open disc is an open set.</li>
<li>Notion of a closed set.</li>
<li>A set is closed iff the limit of every convergent sequence from the set is also in the set.</li>
<li>The closed disc is a closed set.</li>
<li>Boundary of a set.</li>
<li>Closed and bounded sets are called compact.</li>
<li>Polygonally-connected sets.</li>
<li>Open and connected sets are called regions. Regions are polygonally-connected.</li>
