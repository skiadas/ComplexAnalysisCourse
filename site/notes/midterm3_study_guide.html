<p>Things you should know:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Definition of “piecewise differentiable” and “smooth” curves (p. 45)</li>
<li>Definition of integral of a complex function along a curve.</li>
<li>Be able to compute in specific examples (given curve <span class="math">\(\gamma(t)\)</span>, given function <span class="math">\(f(z)\)</span>). Two special cases: Integrals over a horizontal plus vertical segment, integrals over a disc.</li>
<li>Definition of the negative of a curve, <span class="math">\(-C\)</span>, and explanation why the integral over it is the negative of the integral over <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.</li>
<li>The M-L formula and its proof (and the proof of lemma 4.9).</li>
<li>Statement about uniformly convergent sequence of functions and its interaction with the integral.</li>
<li>The version of the fundamental theorem of algebra for line integrals (proposition 4.12) (without proof).</li>
<li>Rectangle theorem and its proof for entire functions. Only statement for convex domains.</li>
<li>Integral theorem and proof for entire functions (using the rectangle theorem to build an antiderivative). Only statement for convex domains.</li>
<li>Closed curve theorem and proof for entire functions.</li>
<li>Second form of rectangle theorem for: functions analytic everywhere except at finitely many points, but continuous at those points. Proof (it was a series of reduction steps to a case where we have a single point of non-analyticity, and it’s a corner point of the rectangle).</li>
<li>Cauchy Integral Formula. Proof for the case where the curve in question is a circle centered at the point in question.</li>
<li>Sketch of the proof that the formula generalizes to any point contained in the disc, not just the center point (our proof consisted of considering a second circle centered at the target point, then breaking the two circles into two paths that avoided the point in question).</li>
<li>Power series expansion of an analytic function around any point, maximum radius of that convergence, integral formula for the coefficients (theorem 6.5).</li>
<li>Liousville’s theorem (two forms, basic and extended) and proof.</li>
<li>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.</li>
<li>Uniqueness theorem for analytic functions on a domain (statement only).</li>
<li>Mean value theorem and maximum modulus theorem (statements only).</li>
